Some observations about the data:

1. math scores and passing rates are lower than reading scores and passing rates
2. district school scores are lower than charter school scores
3. schools with higher budgets had lower math, reading, and overall passing scores. This is most likely explained by #4 or #5
4. big schools (Bailey, Hernandez, Johnson, and Rodriguez) had low scores. there is a distinctive cut off= the 0 to 2499 size had much better results than >2500 size
5. this corresponds to the type -- charter schools are smaller. so, it is unclear whether school size is a significant factor in individual student performance, whether some aspect of charter schools significantly impacts school performance, or whether there is some other factor at play. For example, charter students are self-selecting -- perhaps the student body accounts for the difference. Or, perhaps larger schools tend to be located in areas affected by negative conditions that impact student performance, such as poverty, community education levels, crime rates, etc.
6. overall, then, there's a distinctive set of tendencies, but more research is needed to assert cause.
